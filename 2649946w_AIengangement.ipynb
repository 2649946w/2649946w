    "### Task 2: Identifying Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will make use of one of the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) tutorials and their associated notebooks to learn how to identify different types of bias. Biases can creep in at any stage of the AI task, from data collection methods, how we split/organise the test set, different algorithms, how the results are interpreted and deployed. Some of these topics have been extensively discussed and as a response, Kaggle has developed a course on AI ethics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to the [Kaggle tutorial on Identifying Bias in AI](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/identifying-bias-in-ai/tutorial). \n",
    "- In this section we will explore the [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julian3833/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) to discover different types of biases that might emerge in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2-a: Understanding the Scope of Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Read through the first page of the [Kaggle tutorial on Identifying Bias in AI] to understand the scope of biases discussed at Kaggle.\n",
    "- How many types of biases are described on the page? \n",
    "- Which type of bias did you know about already before this course and which type was new to you? \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the biases discussed in the tutorial are not an exhaustive list. Recall that biases can exist across the entire machine learning pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Scroll down to the end of the Kaggle tutorial page and click on the link to the exercise to work directly with a model and explore the data.** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2-b: Run through the tutorial. Take selected screenshorts of your activity while doing the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss with your peer group, your findings about the biases in the data, including types of biases. \n",
    "- Demonstrate your discussion with examples and screenshots of your activity on the tutorial. Present these in your own notebook.\n",

    "Drummer is most closely associated with a nieghbouring profession bassist. It is well-known in musical circles that the bassist and drummer have toremain well in time with one another so the displaying of their relation by Word2Vec is very interesting. Unlike words such as apple which is associated with directly related ideas, drummer is related to its closest member in the band rather than anything to do with drumming itself.\n",
    "The word mother is associated with ideas of birth, life and nurture whereas the word for man is associated with words like 'warrior' so yes there is concern of some form of gender bias."

    "\n",
    "In this section we will explore the reasons behind decisions that AI makes. While this is really hard to know, there are some approaches developed to know which features in your data (e.g. median_income in the housing dataset we used before) played a more important role than others in determining how your machine learning model performs. One of the many approaches for assessing feature importance is **permutation importance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind permutation importance is simple. Features are what you might consider the columns in a tabulated dataset, such as that might be found in a spreadsheet. \n",
    "- The idea of permutation importance is that a feature is important if the performance of your AI program gets messed up by **shuffling** or **permuting** the order of values in that feature column for the entries in your test data. \n",

Scroll down to the end of the page to the section \"Your Turn\" where you will find a link to an exercise to try it yourself to calculate the importance of features in a Taxi Fare Prediction dataset.\n",

    "1. How many features are in this dataset? \n",
    "2. Were the results of doing the exercise contrary to intuition? If yes, why? If no, why not? \n",
